# EC2EventMonitor
A scanner that utilizes an AWS Credential file to build a list of accounts, then scans all regions in each profile for EC2 instances with events scheduled.

This project should prove useful for folks who need a starting framework for building an app that will access AWS.  It shows how to load credentials and use those credentials to access AWS API calls.
